## BoomBikes Case Study

#### Problem Statement:

BoomBikes has recently suffered considerable dips in their revenues due to the ongoing Corona pandemic.
The company is finding it very difficult to sustain in the current market scenario.
 So, it has decided to come up with a mindful business plan to be able to accelerate its revenue as soon as the ongoing lockdown comes to an end, 
and the economy restores to a healthy state. 

Essentially, the company wants â€”


- To identify the variables used by the management to understand how exactly the demands vary with different features

- To create a linear model that will meet the demand levels and meet the customer's expectations

- Further, the model will be a good way for management to understand the demand dynamics of a new market.
